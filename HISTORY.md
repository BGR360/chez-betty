History of Chez Betty
=====================

- May 20, 2015: Betty bought the triple-wide fridge for $1200. Took 6 or so people
to get it into 2909, but actually cold drinks made it worth it.
- March 2015: Betty bought a freezer. After placing an ice cream order
with the Nestle rep at Kroger, Betty needed more space for frozen items.
Even with the expanded capacity, ice cream remains one of the fastest
sellers.
- July 10, 2014: One of the coolers from the Foo Bar is brought up to the
grad lounge and becomes cold storage for Chez Betty drinks.
- July 8, 2014: Chez Betty is installed in 2817 BBB. After a Costco run, adding
the first batch of items, stocking the shelves, and getting Internet to
the touchscreen and Beagle Bone Black, Betty is alive at 11 PM.
- June 27-29, 2014: 4901 BBB becomes the Chez Betty development office.
- June 20, 2014: Zakir and Brad buy all of the hardware that will become Betty.
- May 2014: After months of procrastination, Brad, Zakir, and Pat decided to set
aside a weekend and build Chez Betty. Pat creates an account with ITS for LDAP
access, but nothing else happens for a while.
- Summer 2013: A video chat with Tristan Halvorson at UCSD reveals that Chez
Betty is definitely worth doing. However, it is clear we are going to have to
build our own system.
- Summer 2013: Brad Campbell, Meghan Clark, Zakir Durumeric, Pat Pannuto decide
"Hey, if UCSD has Chez Bob, we should have Chez Betty."
